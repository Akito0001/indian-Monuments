                <p>The India Gate was part of the work of the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC), which came into
                existence in December 1917 under the British rule for building war graves and memorials to soldiers who
                were killed in the First World War.[3] The foundation stone of the gate then called the All India War
                Memorial, was laid on 10 February 1921, at 16:30, by the visiting Duke of Connaught in a ceremony
                attended by officers and men of the Imperial Indian Army, Imperial Service Troops, the commander in
                chief, and Chelmsford, the viceroy.[4] On the occasion, the viceroy is reported to have said, "The
                stirring tales of individual heroism, will live forever in the annals of this country", and that the
                memorial which was a tribute to the memory of heroes, "known and unknown", would inspire future
                generations to endure hardships with similar fortitude and "no less valor".<br><br> The Duke also read out a
                message by the King, which said, "On this spot, in the central vista of the Capital of India, there will
                stand a Memorial Archway, designed to keep", in the thoughts of future generations, "the glorious
                sacrifice of the officers and men of the Indian Army who fought and fell". During the ceremony, the
                Deccan Horse, 3rd Sappers and Miners, 6th Jat Light Infantry, 34th Sikh Pioneers, 39th Garhwal Rifles,
                59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force), 117th Mahrattas, and 5th Gurkha Rifles.<br><br>
                Ten years after the foundation stone's laying on 12 February 1931, the memorial was inaugurated by Lord
                Irwin, who, on the occasion, said "those who after us shall look upon this monument may learn in
                pondering its purpose something of that sacrifice and service which the names upon its walls record."[5]
                In the decade between the laying of foundation stone of the memorial and its inauguration, the rail-line
                was shifted to run along the Yamuna River, and the New Delhi Railway Station was opened in 1926.<br><br>
                The gate, which is illuminated every evening from 19:00 to 21:30, today serves as one of Delhi's most
                important tourist attractions. Cars used to travel through the gate until it was closed to
                traffic.[citation needed] The Republic Day Parade starts from Rashtrapati Bhavan and passes around the
                India Gate.[citation needed] India gate is often a location for civil society protests, including
                demonstrations in response to the Nirbhaya rape case in 2012 and the Unnao rape case in 2017, and as
                part of the 2011 anti-corruption movement.[7][8][9]<br><br>
                In 2017, the India Gate was twinneAt the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an
                "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart,
                it commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the
                World War I.

            <p>   The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in the
                Northwestern Frontier in the Afghan war of 1919.
                The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it
                was designed by Edwin Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then
                Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan Jyoti was added much later, after India got its
                independence. The eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the nation of soldiers who
                laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.<br><br>
                The entire arch stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge moulding. The
                cornice is inscribed with the Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by the
                dates MCMXIV (1914 left) and MCMXIX (1919 right). The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be
                filled with burning oil on anniversaries but this is rarely done.
                During nightfall, India Gate is dramatically floodlit while the fountains nearby make a lovely display
                with coloured lights. India Gate stands at one end of Rajpath, and the area surrounding it is generally
                referred to as 'India Gate'.<br>

                Surrounding the imposing structure is a large expanse of lush green lawns, which is a popular picnic
                spot. One can see hoards of people moving about the brightly lit area and on the lawns on summer
                evenings.d with the Arch of Remembrance in Leicester, England, another Lutyens war memorial, following a
                very similar design but on a smaller scale. In a ceremony, India's high commissioner to the United
                Kingdom laid a wreath at the arch in Leicester and the British high commissioner to India laid one at
                the India Gate.<br><br><br>
