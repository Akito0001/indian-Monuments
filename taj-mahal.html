                Taj Mahal, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was
                built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen
                One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion
                since their marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely recognized building, it is situated in the
                eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort),
                also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.

                In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is
                distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic
                styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the
                mausoleum), lovely gardens, and a museum. One of the most beautiful structural compositions in the
                world, the Taj Mahal is also one of the world’s most iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists
                each year. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.

            <h1><b>History of construction</b></h1>

            The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief
            architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent. The five principal elements of the
            complex—main gateway, garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”; a building mirroring the mosque), and
            mausoleum (including its four minarets)—were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the
            tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration. Building commenced
            about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to
            complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39; the adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration
            work continued until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22
            years.<br><br>

            A tradition relates that Shah Jahān originally intended to build another mausoleum across the river to house
            his own remains. That structure was to have been constructed of black marble, and it was to have been
            connected by a bridge to the Taj Mahal. He was deposed in 1658 by his son Aurangzeb, however, and was
            imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra Fort.

            <h1><b>Layout and architecture</b></h1>

            Resting in the middle of a wide plinth 23 feet (7 metres) high, the mausoleum proper is of white marble that
            reflects hues according to the intensity of sunlight or moonlight. It has four nearly identical facades,
            each with a wide central arch rising to 108 feet (33 metres) at its apex and chamfered (slanted) corners
            incorporating smaller arches. The majestic central dome, which reaches a height of 240 feet (73 metres) at
            the tip of its finial, is surrounded by four lesser domes. The acoustics inside the main dome cause the
            single note of a flute to reverberate five times. The interior of the mausoleum is organized around an
            octagonal marble chamber ornamented with low-relief carvings and semiprecious stones (pietra dura). Therein
            are the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahān. Those false tombs are enclosed by a finely wrought
            filigree marble screen. Beneath the tombs, at garden level, lie the true sarcophagi. Standing gracefully
            apart from the central building, at each of the four corners of the square plinth, are elegant
            minarets.<br><br>

            Flanking the mausoleum near the northwestern and northeastern edges of the garden, respectively, are two
            symmetrically identical buildings—the mosque, which faces east, and its jawāb, which faces west and provides
            aesthetic balance. Built of red Sikri sandstone with marble-necked domes and architraves, they contrast in
            both colour and texture with the mausoleum’s white marble.
            </p>

                The garden is set out along classical Mughal lines—a square quartered by long watercourses (pools)—with
                walking paths, fountains, and ornamental trees. Enclosed by the walls and structures of the complex, it
                provides a striking approach to the mausoleum, which can be seen reflected in the garden’s central
                pools.<br><br>
                The southern end of the complex is graced by a wide red sandstone gateway with a recessed central arch
                two stories high. White marble paneling around the arch is inlaid with black Qurʾānic lettering and
                floral designs. The main arch is flanked by two pairs of smaller arches. Crowning the northern and
                southern facades of the gateway are matching rows of white chattris (chhattris; cupola-like structures),
                11 to each facade, accompanied by thin ornamental minarets that rise to some 98 feet (30 metres). At the
                four corners of the structure are octagonal towers capped with larger chattris.<br><br>


                Two notable decorative features are repeated throughout the complex: pietra dura and Arabic calligraphy.
                As embodied in the Mughal craft, pietra dura (Italian: “hard stone”) incorporates the inlay of
                semiprecious stones of various colours, including lapis lazuli, jade, crystal, turquoise, and amethyst,
                in highly formalized and intertwining geometric and floral designs. The colours serve to moderate the
                dazzling expanse of the white Makrana marble. Under the direction of Amānat Khan al-Shīrāzī, verses from
                the Qurʾān were inscribed across numerous sections of the Taj Mahal in calligraphy, central to Islamic
                artistic tradition. One of the inscriptions in the sandstone gateway is known as Daybreak (89:28–30) and
                invites the faithful to enter paradise. Calligraphy also encircles the soaring arched entrances to the
                mausoleum proper. To ensure a uniform appearance from the vantage point of the terrace, the lettering
                increases in size according to its relative height and distance from the viewer.<br><br>
