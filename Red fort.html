                    <h> Red Fort Complex</h>
                </b>
                The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal
                Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to
                an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort
                Complex. The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel,
                known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of
                Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of
                the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of
                Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative
                planning and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and
                gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.

               <b> Outstanding Universal Value</b><br>
                The planning and design of the Red Fort represents a culmination of architectural development initiated
                in 1526 AD by the first Mughal Emperor and brought to a splendid refinement by Shah Jahan with a fusion
                of traditions: Islamic, Persian, Timurid and Hindu. The innovative planning arrangements and
                architectural style of building components as well as garden design developed in the Red Fort strongly
                influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield. The Red Fort has
                been the setting for events which have had a critical impact on its geo-cultural region.<br><br>

                Criterion (ii): The final flourishing of Mughal architecture built upon local traditions but enlivened
                them with imported ideas, techniques, craftsmanship and designs to provide a fusion of Islamic, Persian,
                Timurid and Hindu traditions. The Red Fort demonstrates the outstanding results this achieved in
                planning and architecture.<br><br>

                Criterion (iii): The innovative planning arrangements and architectural style of building components and
                garden design developed in the Red Fort strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan,
                Delhi, Agra and further afield. The Red Fort Complex also reflects the phase of British military
                occupation, introducing new buildings and functions over the earlier Mughal structures.<br><br>

                Criterion (vi): The Red Fort has been a symbol of power since the reign of Shah Jahan, has witnessed the
                change in Indian history to British rule, and was the place where Indian independence was first
                celebrated, and is still celebrated today. The Red Fort Complex has thus been the setting of events
                critical to the shaping of regional identity, and which have had a wide impact on the geo-cultural
                region.<br><br>

                The Red Fort Complex is a layered expression of both Mughal architecture and planning, and the later
                British military use of the forts. The most dramatic impacts on the integrity of the Red Fort Complex
                come from the change of the river into a major road, which alters the relationship of the property to
                its intended setting; and from the division of the Salimgarh Fort by a railway. Nevertheless the
                Salimgarh Fort is inextricably linked to the Red Fort in use and later history. The integrity of the
                Salimgarh Fort can only be seen in terms of its value as part of the overall Red Fort Complex. The
                authenticity of the Mughal and British buildings in the Red Fort Complex is established, although more
                work is needed to establish the veracity of the current garden layout. In the specific case of the
                Salimgarh Fort, the authenticity of the Mughal period is related to knowledge of its use and
                associations, and of the built structures dating from the British period.<br><br>

                The nominated property has been declared a monument of national importance under the Ancient Monument
                and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1959. A buffer zone has been established. Although the state
                of conservation of the property has improved over the past ten years, much more work is needed to put
                the overall state of the property into a stable condition and to ensure visitors do not contribute to
                its decay. The Red Fort Complex is managed directly by the Archaeological Survey of India, which is also
                responsible for the protection of all national level heritage sites in India and Indian cultural
                properties included in the World Heritage List.<br><br>
