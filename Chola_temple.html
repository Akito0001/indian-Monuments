            <h1>Great Living Chola Temples</h1> </b>
            The Great Living Chola Temples were built by kings of the Chola Empire, which stretched over all of
            south India and the neighbouring islands. The site includes three great 11th- and 12th-century Temples:
            the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, the Brihadisvara Temple at Gangaikondacholisvaram and the
            Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram. The Temple of Gangaikondacholisvaram, built by Rajendra I, was
            completed in 1035. Its 53-m vimana (sanctum tower) has recessed corners and a graceful upward curving
            movement, contrasting with the straight and severe tower at Thanjavur. The Airavatesvara temple complex,
            built by Rajaraja II, at Darasuram features a 24-m vimana and a stone image of Shiva. The temples
            testify to the brilliant achievements of the Chola in architecture, sculpture, painting and bronze
            casting.

                <b><h>Outstanding Universal Value<br></h></b>
               <b> Brief synthesis<br><br></b>

                The great Cholas established a powerful monarchy in the 9th CE at Thanjavur and in its surroundings.
                They enjoyed a long, eventful rule lasting for four and a half centuries with great achievements in all
                fields of royal endeavour such as military conquest, efficient administration, cultural assimilation and
                promotion of art. All three temples, the Brihadisvara at Thanjavur, the Brihadisvara at
                Gangaikondacholapuram and Airavatesvara at Darasuram, are living temples. The tradition of temple
                worship and rituals established and practised over a thousand years ago, based on still older Agamic
                texts, continues daily, weekly and annually, as an inseparable part of life of the people.<br><br>

                These three temple complexes therefore form a unique group, demonstrating a progressive development of
                high Chola architecture and art at its best and at the same time encapsulating a very distinctive period
                of Chola history and Tamil culture.<br><br>

                <b>The Brihadisvara temple at Tanjavur marks the greatest achievement of the Chola architects. Known in the
                inscriptions as Dakshina Meru, the construction of this temple was inaugurated by the Chola King,
                Rajaraja I (985-1012 CE) possibly in the 19th regal year (1003-1004 CE) and consecrated by his own hands
                in the 25th regal year (1009-1010 CE). A massive colonnaded prakara with sub-shrines dedicated to the
                ashatadikpalas and a main entrance with gopura (known as Rajarajantiruvasal) encompasses the massive
                temple. The sanctum itself occupies the centre of the rear half of the rectangular court. The vimana
                soars to a height of 59.82meters over the ground. This grand elevation is punctuated by a high upapitha,
                adhisthana with bold mouldings; the ground tier (prastara) is divided into two levels, carrying images
                of Siva. Over this rises the 13 talas and is surmounted by an octagonal sikhara. There is a
                circumambulatory path all around the sanctum housing a massive linga. The temple walls are embellished
                with expansive and exquisite mural paintings. Eighty-one of the one hundred and eight karanas, posed in
                Baharatanatya,are carved on the walls of second bhumi around the garbhagriha. There is a shrine
                dedicated to Amman dating to c.13th century.<br><br>

                Outside the temple enclosure are the fort walls of the Sivaganga Little Fort surrounded by a moat, and
                the Sivaganga Tank, constructed by the Nayaks of Tanjore of the 16th century who succeeded the imperial
                Cholas. The fort walls enclose and protect the temple complex within and form part of the protected area
                by the Archaeological Survey of India.<br><br>

                The Brihadisvara temple at Gangaikondacholapuram in the Perambalur district was built for Siva by
                Rajendra I (1012-1044 CE). The temple has sculptures of exceptional quality. The bronzes of Bhogasakti
                and Subrahmanya are masterpieces of Chola metal icons. The Saurapitha (Solar altar), the lotus altar
                with eight deities, is considered auspicious.<br><br>

                The Airavatesvara temple at Tanjavur was built by the Chola king Rajaraja II (1143-1173 CE.): it is much
                smaller in size as compared to the Brihadisvara temple at Tanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram. It differs
                from themin itshighly ornate execution. The temple consists of a sanctum without a circumambulatory path
                and axial mandapas. The front mandapa known in the inscriptions as Rajagambhiran tirumandapam, is unique
                as it was conceptualized as a chariot with wheels. The pillars of this mandapa are highly ornate. The
                elevation of all the units is elegant with sculptures dominating the architecture. A number of
                sculptures from this temple are the masterpieces of Chola art. The labelled miniature friezes extolling
                the events that happened to the 63 nayanmars (Saiva saints) are noteworthy and reflect the deep roots of
                Saivism in this region. The construction of a separate temple for Devi, slightly later than the main
                temple, indicates the emergence of the Amman shrine as an essential component of the South Indian temple
                complex.<br><br></b>

               <b> Criterion (i)</b>: The three Chola temples of Southern India represent an outstanding creative achievement
                in the architectural conception of the pure form of the dravida type of temple.<br>

               <b> Criterion (ii)</b>: The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur became the first great example of the Chola
                temples, followed by a development of which the other two properties also bear witness.<br>

                <b>Criterion (iii)</b>: The three Great Chola Temples are an exceptional and the most outstanding testimony to
                the development of the architecture of the Chola Empire and the Tamil civilisation in Southern
                India.<br>

                <b>Criterion (iv)</b>: The Great Chola temples at Thanjavur, at Gangaikondacholapuram and Darasuram are
                outstanding examples of the architecture and the representation of the Chola ideology.<br>

                <b>
                    <b><h>Integrity</b></h><br><br>
                </b>

                These temples represent the development of Dravida architecture from Chola period to Maratha Period. All
                three monuments have been in a good state of preservation from the date of the inscription of the
                property and no major threats affect the World Heritage monuments. These monuments are being maintained
                and monitored by the Archaeological Survey of India. The tradition of temple worship and rituals
                established and practiced over a thousand years ago, based on still older Agamic texts, continues daily,
                weekly and annually, as an inseparable part of life of the people.<br><br>

                <b>Authenticity</b><br><br>

                The three properties are considered to pass the test of authenticity in relation to their conception,
                material and execution. The temples are still being used, and they have great archaeological and
                historical value. The temple complexes used to be part of major royal towns, but have remained as the
                outstanding features in todayâ€™s mainly rural context. The components of the temple complex of the
                Brihadisvara at Thanjavur, declared a World Heritage property in 1987, includes six sub-shrines which
                have been added within the temple courtyard over a period of time. The later additions and interventions
                reinforce the original concept embodied in the main temple complex, in keeping with homogeneity and its
                overall integrity. The traditional use of the temple for worship and ritual contribute to the
                authenticity. However the periodic report of 2003 noted a number of conservation interventions that have
                the potential to impact on authenticity e.g chemical cleaning of the structures and the total
                replacement of the temple floor; highlighting the need for a Conservation Management Plan to guide the
                conservation of the property so as to ensure that authenticity is maintained.<br><br>

                Similarly at the Brihadisvara complex at Gangaikondacholapuram, the sub-shrines of Chandesa and Amman
                were originally built according to the plan of Rajendra I, as well as the Simhakeni (the lion-well).Over
                time The sub-shrines of Thenkailasha, Ganesha and Durga were added. The authenticity of these additions
                is supported by the Agamictexts concerning renewal and reconstructions of temples in use.<br><br>

                At Darasuram, archaeological evidence since gazettal enhances the authenticity of the property. The
                Airavatesvara temple complex itself has been entirely built at the same time with no later additional
                structures, and remains in its original form. The Deivanayaki Amman shrine built a little later also,
                stands in its original form within its own enclosure.<br><br>


                <b>Notes</b>
                The "Brihadisvara Temple, Tanjavur", which was previously inscribed on the World Heritage List, is part
               <br> of the "Great Living Chola Temples".<br><br>
