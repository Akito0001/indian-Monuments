                Hawa Mahal, palace in the Indian city of Jaipur that was designed by Lal Chand Ustad for Maharaja Sawai
                Pratap Singh, the grandson of the founder of Jaipur, and was completed in 1799. Regarded as one of the
                iconic symbols of the state of Rajasthan, it sits in the center of Rajasthan’s capital city.
                Built as an extension to the women’s chambers of the City Palace, Hawa Mahal was intended as a viewing
                screen. Through this screen—a kind of architectural veil—women of the royal household could freely view
                the bazaar and its vibrant proceedings unseen. The term mahal in this context is almost misleading, as
                the building was never meant to serve as a residence. The five-story building is actually quite shallow,
                with the top three stories being barely a room deep and containing chambers in which the women sat.

                In keeping with the visual language of the “Pink City” of Jaipur, the Hawa Mahal is built entirely in
                red sandstone, which in the sunlight glows with a pink hue. It is often identified as the world’s
                tallest building constructed without a foundation. Although it is credited to the Rajput style of
                architecture, it also has very strong Mughal influences manifested in the symmetry of the facade. This
                facade, which is 50 feet (15 m) high, has 953 windows, each painted with motifs in white limewash. The
                main entrance is at the rear of the building, where a series of ramps lead to the upper stories. These
                were designed to facilitate palanquins (chairs carried on men’s shoulders).<br><br>

                The intricate latticework of the Hawa Mahal allows the breeze to keep the internal spaces cool,
                explaining the name of the structure, which can be translated as “Palace of the Winds.” The building,
                maintained by Rajasthan’s archeological department, was renovated in 2006 and is open to tourism.

                Jaipur, city, capital of Rajasthan state, northwestern India. It is situated in the east-central part of
                the state, roughly equidistant from Alwar (northeast) and Ajmer (southwest). It is Rajasthan’s
                most-populous city.<br><br>

                A walled town surrounded (except to the south) by hills, the city was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Sawai
                Jai Singh to replace nearby Amber (now Amer, a part of Jaipur) as the capital of the princely state of
                Jaipur (founded by the Rajputs in the 12th century CE). Jaipur grew dramatically in size in the late
                20th and early 21st centuries, doubling its population between 1991 and 2011. It has a mixed
                Hindu-Muslim population. The city was the site of numerous bombing attacks in the early 21st century,
                with mosques and Hindu temples being targets.<br><br>
                Jaipur is a popular tourist destination and a commercial trade centre with major road, rail, and air
                connections. Industries include engineering and metalworking, hand-loom weaving, distilling, and the
                manufacture of glass, hosiery, carpets, blankets, shoes, and drugs. Jaipur’s famous arts and crafts
                include the making of jewelry, enamel, metalwork, and printed cloths, as well as stone, marble, and
                ivory carving.<br><br>

                The city is known for its beauty, and it is unique in its straight-line planning. Its buildings are
                predominantly rose-coloured, and it is sometimes called the “pink city.” The chief buildings are the
                City Palace, part of which is home to the royal family of Jaipur; Jantar Mantar, an 18th-century
                open-air observatory that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2010; Hawa Mahal (Hall of
                Winds); Ram Bagh palace; and Nahargarh, the Tiger Fort. Other public buildings include a museum and a
                library. Jaipur is the seat of the University of Rajasthan, founded in 1947.<br><br>

                The city is surrounded by fertile alluvial plains to the east and south and hill chains and desert areas
                to the north and west. Bajra (pearl millet), barley, gram (chickpeas), pulses, and cotton are the chief
                crops grown in the region. Iron ore, beryllium, mica, feldspar, marble, copper, and garnet deposits are
                worked. In addition to Amer, other nearby attractions include Sariska National Park to the northeast.
